<!-- Add other relevant badges here: build status, version, etc. -->

**HorusAgentOS** is a revolutionary open-source framework for building intelligent agents that can autonomously operate computers, much like a human user. It integrates state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), multi-modal perception, and reinforcement learning to provide powerful and flexible desktop automation across multiple platforms.

**Core Vision:** "Empower AI to become your digital twin, autonomously executing complex desktop tasks."

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Multi-Modal Perception:** Understands user interfaces by combining:
    *   Screen Capture Analysis
    *   Accessibility Tree Parsing
    *   Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
*   **Precise Interaction:** Accurately simulates human-like mouse clicks, keyboard inputs, and other UI interactions.
*   **Enhanced Memory System:**
    *   **Narrative Memory:** Records overall task trajectories and reflections.
    *   **Episodic Memory:** Stores detailed sub-task execution processes and summaries.
    *   **Knowledge Accumulation:** Continuously learns from experiences to improve efficiency and decision-making.
*   **Advanced Planning & Decision-Making:**
    *   **Hierarchical Task Planning:** Decomposes complex user requests into manageable sub-tasks using LLMs.
    *   **Dynamic Strategy Adjustment:** Adapts plans in real-time based on execution feedback.
    *   **Reinforcement Learning:** Optimizes decision strategies over time.
*   **Multi-Agent Collaboration (Future Goal):** Designed to support multiple agents working in concert to tackle complex workflows.
*   **Developer-Friendly:**
    *   **Unified Python API:** Clean and easy-to-use interfaces.
    *   **Modular Architecture:** Clear separation of concerns for extensibility.
    *   **(Planned) Comprehensive Documentation:** Detailed guides and examples.

## üèõÔ∏è Technical Architecture

HorusAgentOS utilizes a modular architecture composed of five key layers:

1.  **Perception Layer:** Responsible for understanding the computer's screen and UI elements.
    *   _Components:_ Screen Analysis, OCR, Accessibility Tree Parsing, Multi-Modal Fusion.
    *   _Key Technologies:_ `mss`, `pytesseract`, `pywinauto` (Windows), `pyobjc` (macOS AXAPI), `python-atspi` (Linux), `OpenCV`, `Pillow`.

2.  **Decision Layer:** The "brain" of the agent, responsible for task planning and execution management.
    *   _Components:_ Task Planner (LLM-based), Execution Controller, Reinforcement Learning Engine, Multi-Agent Coordinator.
    *   _Key Technologies:_ LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI), Transformers, HTN/PDDL concepts, `Stable Baselines3`/`RLlib`.

3.  **Action Layer:** Executes the planned actions on the GUI.
    *   _Components:_ GUI Interaction Engine, Cross-Platform Drivers, Automation Script Generation, Error Recovery.
    *   _Key Technologies:_ `pyautogui`, `pywinauto`, AppleScript/JXA, `xdotool`.

4.  **Memory Layer:** Enables the agent to learn from past experiences.
    *   _Components:_ Long-Term Memory Storage (Vector DBs), Knowledge Retrieval, Experience Summarization & Generalization, Memory Update Strategy.
    *   _Key Technologies:_ Vector Databases (`FAISS`, `Weaviate`, etc.), Sentence Transformers, `SQLite`/`PostgreSQL`.

5.  **Communication Layer:** Facilitates interaction between modules, other agents, and external systems.
    *   _Components:_ Internal Communication Protocol, External System Integration, API Interface, Multi-Agent Communication.
    *   _Key Technologies:_ Message Queues (`RabbitMQ`, `Kafka`), RPC (`gRPC`), API Frameworks (`FastAPI`, `Flask`).

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is currently under active development. The following provides a conceptual overview of installation and usage.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+ (Recommended: 3.10 or 3.11 for broader library compatibility)
*   `pip` (Python package installer)
*   Platform-specific dependencies for GUI automation and perception (details to be provided).
    *   **Windows:** May require specific C++ build tools for some libraries.
    *   **macOS:** Xcode command-line tools.
    *   **Linux:** `tesseract-ocr`, `scrot`, `xdotool`, `libxtst-dev`, `python3-tk`, `python3-dev`, etc.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository (once public)
# git clone https://github.com/yourusername/horusagentos.git
# cd horusagentos

# Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv .venv
# On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies (a requirements.txt will be provided)
# pip install -r requirements.txt

# For now, if you have the source code directly:
# pip install . 
# or for editable mode:
# pip install -e .
```

(Note: `pip install HorusAgentOS` from PyPI will be available upon official release.)

### Basic Usage (Conceptual)

```python
from horusagentos import HorusAgentOS

# Configuration for the LLM (example for OpenAI)
llm_config = {
    "provider": "openai", # or "huggingface", "local_llm_provider"
    "model": "gpt-4o",    # Choose your preferred model
    "api_key": "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY" # Securely manage your API keys
}

# Optional agent-wide configurations for different modules
agent_settings = {
    'perception_config': {'ocr_engine': 'tesseract_best'}, # Example
    'action_config': {'default_delay_ms': 200},      # Example
    'memory_config': {'db_path': './agent_memory.sqlite'} # Example
}

# Initialize the agent
agent = HorusAgentOS(llm_provider_config=llm_config, agent_config=agent_settings)

# Define a task in natural language
task_instruction = "Open the Chrome browser, search for the official HorusAgentOS GitHub page, and save the link to a file named 'horus_link.txt' on the desktop."

# Execute the task
result = agent.execute_task(task_instruction)

# Print the outcome
print(f"Task Status: {result.get('status')}")
print(f"Message: {result.get('message')}")
if result.get('plan'):
    print("Generated Plan:")
    for i, step in enumerate(result['plan']):
        print(f"  Step {i+1}: {step.get('description', step.get('action'))} - Params: {step.get('params')}")
if result.get('results') and result['results'].get('step_results'):
    print("Execution Details:")
    for i, step_res in enumerate(result['results']['step_results']):
        print(f"  Step {i+1} Outcome: Success={step_res.get('success')}, Details: {step_res.get('details')}")

```
