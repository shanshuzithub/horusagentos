# tech.md: 4.4. Memory Layer
# - Long-Term Memory Storage: Persists historical task experiences (e.g., using vector databases).
# - Knowledge Retrieval System: Quickly retrieves relevant experiences based on similarity.
# - Experience Summarization and Generalization: Extracts generalizable knowledge from specific cases.
# - Memory Update Strategy: Periodically optimizes and prunes outdated memories.

# Key Technologies/Libraries:
# *   Vector Databases: `FAISS`, `Annoy`, `Pinecone`, `Weaviate`.
# *   Embedding Models: Sentence Transformers (e.g., `sentence-transformers` library).
# *   Databases: `SQLite`, `PostgreSQL` for structured metadata.
